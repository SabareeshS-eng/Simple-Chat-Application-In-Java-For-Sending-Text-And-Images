# Simple-Chat-Application-In-Java-For-Sending-Text-And-Images
In this I have created a simple chat application in java which can be used to send both text as well as images from your pc. The UI is similar to Whatsapp, a well-known chat application. In this one will act as a client and another will act as a server. This is an application based on the client-server model. 

# How to run?
Open a command prompt or terminal and first run the Server.java program to create a server since, the server must be created first. Then, open another command prompt or terminal and run the Client.java program. 

# Future works
For now this application can be implement in a single machine. In future it will be improved to work in different machines.
